##  fundamentals of a good developer :

  * Understanding is the key difference between a bad developer and a good developer. 

4- Simplicity.

 5-Complexity
  * Your main purpose is to control complexity, not to create it.

6- Maintenance
 * It is more important to reduce the effort of maintenance than it is to reduce the effort of implementation.

 7- Consistency
  * Consistency is a big part of simplicity. If you do something one way in one place, do it that way in every place.

8-  Prioritizing
 * The changes that will bring you a lot of value and require little effort are better than those that will bring little value and require a lot of effort.

9-  Solving Problems
   * understanding the problems 
   * planning 
   * dividing the problems 

10-  Predictions
